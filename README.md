# Mini E-Commerce App

## About the Project

This is a simple **Mini E-Commerce App** I built as part of my web development journey. The app allows users to view a list of products, add items to a cart or wishlist, and navigate between different pages (Home, Wishlist, Cart) while maintaining the state using **localStorage**. It is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with a responsive design to work on different screen sizes.

### Features:
- **Product Listing**: Products are displayed dynamically with their details such as name, category, price, and rating.
- **Add to Cart and Wishlist**: Users can click to add products to their cart or wishlist with a confirmation message. 
- **Persistence**: Cart and wishlist data is saved in the browser's **localStorage**, so the data stays even after navigating between pages or refreshing.
- **Responsive Layout**: The app adjusts to different screen sizes â€” 3 cards on large screens, 2 on medium screens, and 1 on smaller screens.
